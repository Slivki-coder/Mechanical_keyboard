# June 26th: Started working on the pcb, mainly the schematic.

I watched and read a few tutorials on how to design a keyboard before beginning to do so myself. I tried multiple approaches, for example using an STM32 microchip for controlling, but that seemed too complicated for my skill level, and since I didnt want to copy someone else's work, I opted for using the raspberry pi pico. After this, I designed the schematic.

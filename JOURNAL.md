# June 26th: Started working on the pcb, mainly the schematic.

I watched and read a few tutorials on how to design a keyboard before beginning to do so myself. I tried multiple approaches, for example using an STM32 microchip for controlling, but that seemed too complicated for my skill level, and since I didnt want to copy someone else's work, I opted for using the raspberry pi pico. After this, I designed the schematic.

# June 27th: Finished wiring the PCB

I wired all the switches on my PCB to my controller

# June 29th: Redesigned everything because the pcb was too messy

My previous attempt required 4 layers, had traces going everywhere and like 5 vias per trace. Because of that, I decided to redesign my schematic (this time keeping the final layout in mind) and then also completely redo the PCB. Now I only need 2 layers, 0 vias and the traces are pretty organised.

# June 30th: Started working on the 3d model

I started working on the case for the keyboard. I finished the top plate and also started working on the main casing. (The screenshots were made on a later date since I forgot to take them at that time, so some changes may be present which I added a day later)

# July 1st: Finished 3d modeling and created the firmware

I finished the 3d model of the case and added a stand to add a 6 degree slope to it. I also added small holes on the bottom of the case and the stand for magnets which are supposed to hold the 2 parts together, and slightly larger holes on the bottom of the stand to add silicone pads to stop it from sliding across the table.
